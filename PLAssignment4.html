		<p>I wrote my parser in JavaScript as I have been wanting to learn it. JavaScript is a very useful language and it is widely used for many web applications. I went through many YouTube videos and some <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/parse.html" target="_blank">w3school tutorials</a>. The hardest part was figuring out how to output the result on the webpage instead of in the console. The assignment wasnâ€™t tough and gave a lot of learning experience, mixing the three HTML, CSS and JavaScript was fun. For anyone looking to learn their way I would recommend watching YouTube tutorial, and for output use< paragraph id. This is the hardest part because there is so much information out there that the particulars may not be easy to find but watching some beginner tutorials on JavaScript and HTML should point in the right direction.
